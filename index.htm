    <h3>Audition for this term's panto, Sat 28th - Sun 29th January</h3>
    <p>Anna is looking for True Love but her sister Elsa wants anything but. Together they meet Some Random Dude in the Woods named Kristoff who is - inexplicitly - in love with his reindeer, and Olli the Snowperson. Together they work to resolve the plot whilst singing catchy David Bowie and Queen parodies: What could possibly go wrong? Will Elsa be forced to marry against her will? Will Anna ever find true love? Will the evil Hans of Ferreton succeed?</p>

    <h3>Come audition! It's not scary</h3>
    <p>We have two auditions this term, which are each slightly different. On Saturday we have <b>drop-in solo auditions</b>, if you prefer to audition individually. On Sunday we have a <b>big group audition</b>, with lots of <b>improv games</b> and the opportunity to <b>try out multiple parts</b>. We want to make auditioning as fun and welcoming as possible, so come along to whichever of these you prefer the sound of!</p>

    <p>Below are more details about each of the auditions. If you would like to take part but can't do either of those times, then please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk</a> and we'll make sure you're included.</p>

    <h4>SATURDAY 28th JANUARY</h4>
    <p>The solo auditions are on Saturday, between 7pm and 9pm. These will be held in the Blythe Room, on the <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/HHNYDFoGcom">Clare College Colony site just off Chesterton Lane.</a></p>
    <p>Once you arrive at the Porters Lodge, you can find the Blythe room by continuing into the Colony site, turning left at the red brick building and heading through the small car park which should now be in front of you. Once you're through here, the entrance to the Blythe Room will be on your right.</p>

    <h4>SUNDAY 29th JANUARY</h4>
    <p>The group audition will be held in the Gatehouse, in <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/XeJ9xEUkyyT2">Clare College Memorial Court off Queens Road</a> from 4pm to 6pm.</p>
    <p>If you enter Memorial Court from Queens Road, then you will find the Gatehouse on the far side of the Court. Enter past the Porters Lodge and continue straight to go around the Library; you'll find the Gatehouse by the rear gate of the Court, on your right.</p>
    <p>This is also very close to the University Library, so you may prefer to head there and enter Clare by the rear gate. If you walk in through this gate, then you will be right by the door to the Gatehouse.</p>

    <p>If you have any other questions about CULES or the auditions then please do get in touch, either with me, Sam (<a href="mailto:sc740@cam.ac.uk">sc740@cam.ac.uk</a>) or the committee (<a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>).</p>

    
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    </div>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>

    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>


    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
