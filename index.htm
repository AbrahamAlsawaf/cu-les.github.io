    <p class="padded-top">CULES is proud to present its Michaelmas pantomime, Happily Ever After! It contains fairytale princesses, evil queens, reformed dragons and other fun things. At CULES, we tour our shows around the local community and end the term with public performances, which we'd love you to join us for!</p>
    <p>Our public performances will be at 6pm on Thursday 30th November and 7pm on Friday 1st December. Both shows are in the Homerton College Auditorium and doors will open 15 minutes before the start time.</p>
    <p>We don't sell tickets for our shows but there is a suggested Â£5 donation at the door and all the money raised will go to charity. It will be split between causes dear to Gill Conquest, one of the writers of this show who sadly passed away earlier this year.</p>

    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>
        <cite><a href="http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/features/0033823-student-spotlight-the-cambridge-university-light-entertainment-society.html">Sam Raby, The Cambridge Student</a></cite>
    </div>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    
    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
