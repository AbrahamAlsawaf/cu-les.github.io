    <h2>UNFROZEN</h2>
    <h4>Saturday 3rd December, venue TBC</h4>
    <p>Anna is looking for True Love but her sister Elsa wants anything but. Together they meet Some Random Dude in the Woods named Kristoff who is - inexplicitly - in love with his reindeer, and Olli the Snowperson. Together they work to resolve the plot whilst singing catchy David Bowie and Queen parodies: What could possibly go wrong? Will Elsa be forced to marry against her will? Will Anna ever find true love? Will the evil Hans of Ferreton succeed? </p>

    
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>

    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>


    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
