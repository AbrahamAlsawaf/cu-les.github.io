    <p class="padded-top">We're very excited to announce the Cambridge University Light
    Entertainment Society's Michaelmas pantomime, Once Upon Three Princesses
    by Jasmin Thien.</p>
    
    <p>Cinderella and Snow White are tired of being recognised only for their
        pretty faces. The solution? Going on a mission to defeat the Wicked
        Queen and win recognition as fierce and independent ladies in their own
        right. It's a fun and silly pantomime, featuring beloved characters such
        as Nala, Guss-Guss the Mouse, and an adorable lion with a split
        personality!</p>

    <p>If you want to come and see the show (which of course you do) then come
        along to Pembroke New Cellars on Saturday 24th November at 2:30 pm. As
        always, the show is free to attend, and we'll be collecting donations
        for Women's Aid (suggested donation: Â£5).</p>
    
    <p>It's going to be an amazing show and we'd love to see a big audience.
        Bring your friends and anyone with an interest in silly theatre!</p>
        
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    
    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
