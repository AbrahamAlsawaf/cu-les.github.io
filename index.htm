    <h1>Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society</h1>

    <h2>Auditions: Saturday 14th &amp; Sunday 15th October</h2>

    <p>Auditions for our Michaelmas show, <i>Happily Ever After</i>, will be taking place <b>Saturday 14th October from 5pm to 7pm, and Sunday 15th October from 2pm to 4pm in the Blythe Room, Clare College Colony</b>. Both of these are relaxed, drop-in group auditions, where you can read and act out parts as a group. If you would prefer a solo audition, or can't make either of these times, <a href="mailto:jhe25@cam.ac.uk">please contact me (Jon)</a> so we can arrange an audition slot for you.</p>
    <p>The show is a Fairytale Pantomime about the Princess Periwinkle trying to save her kidnapped brother, Prince Dashing, from an Evil Queen.</p>
    <p>There are both small parts and large parts to try out, and <b>everyone who auditions gets a part</b>. So whether you want to steal the centre stage, or just want to dip your toe in to theatre, there's a part for you. Including: Royalty, Jesters, Evil Witches, Henchthings, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Huntersâ„¢, The Head, Stomach, and Arse of a Dragon (all speaking parts), and more!</p>

    <h2>Directions to auditions</h2>
    <p>The Blythe Room, on the Clare College Colony Site, is just off Chesterton Lane. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/z8a2gU5fkdx">Here is a map showing where the Colony is</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you arrive at the Porter's Lodge, you can find the Blythe Building by continuing into the Colony site, turning left at the big red brick building, and heading through the small car park which should now be in front of you. Once through here, the entrance to the Blythe Room is on the right.</p>

    If you have any other questions <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">please do get in touch with the committee</a>.
        
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    
    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
