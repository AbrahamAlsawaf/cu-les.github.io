    </div>

    <p class="padded-top">We're very excited to announce the Cambridge University Light
    Entertainment Society's (remote) Easter term productions: "In The Nick Of Time" - a comedy radioplay
    by Grace Beckett and Henry Weighill, and "Nothing To See Here" - a sketch show featuring sketches 
    by Gregory Miller, Anna Trowby and Ido Rosen.</p>
    
    <p>After a very brief hiatus, CULES is making a grand (albeit rather poorly 
        timed) return. Though we are in uncertain and unprecedented times, 
        CULES will always strive to bring a smile to your face and provide fun, silly 
        comedy theatre where it is most needed. This Easter term, we will be raising money for
        <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/">The Trussell Trust</a>. Watch this page for updates!</p>
    
    <h2>In The Nick Of Time</h3>
    
    <p>Four WWII Bletchley Park codebreakers are accidentally transported to the 21st Century! Follow them 
        through their hilarious mishaps and encounters with the modern world as they venture back to the HQ.
        How many tickets can you get at the pictures for 5 shillings these days? Just what breed is Polly 
        the dog? And will the codebreakers make it back to the past before teatime?</p>
    
    <h2>Nothing To See Here</h3>
    
    <p>Are you interested in vacuum cleaners? Yoga? Bananas? Haunted hotels? We got you covered. CULES is 
        bringing you a rather bizarre collection of sketches, nicely wrapped and tied together with a silky
        ribbon of Absurdity to lighten up your quarantine. And we'll be doing it for charity!</p>
         
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    
    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
