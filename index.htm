    <h1>Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society</h1>

    <h2 class="unfrozen text--center">UNFROZEN</h2>
    <h3 class="text--center padded-bottom">6pm, Saturday 18th March &ndash; Riley Auditorium, Clare College</h3>

    <p>UnFrozen is a pantomime based on the hit Disney movie Frozen, but with more Queen and Bowie covers thrown in for good measure!</p>

    <p>Ana dreams of falling in love with her fairy tale prince, but Elsa wants anything but that! After an argument over the hapless Prince Hans, Ana goes on an adventure to find her sister and repair their relationship. Along the way she meets Kristoff, his oddly anthropomorphised reindeer Sven, and Olli the snowperson, who show her there's more to life and the human condition than she ever thought possible. It's the perfect, heartwarming end to your Lent term!</p>

    <p>In typical CULES fashion, we do not sell tickets for this show but we collect donations on entry (the suggested amount is Â£5 per person), which goes to charity.</p>

    <p>We also have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1338854242848786/">Facebook event for the show</a>.</p>

    <h3>Directions to the Riley Auditorium</h3>

    <p>The Riley Auditorium is in the Gillespie Centre, on the Memorial Court site of Clare College. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tq9djFzer2S2">Here's a map showing Memorial Court</a>.</p>

    <p>The main entrance to Memorial Court is off Queens Road; if you arrive here then as enter the Court you'll pass the Porter's Lodge on your left. Head forwards into the Court and follow the curving path to your right, past the Library. On the other side, you want to take the passageway through the building on your right, just after S staircase, to come through to Lerner Court, which is where you'll find the Gillespie Centre. The Centre itself will be on your left; head through the main door and down the stairs (or lift) to reach the Riley Auditorium.</p>
    <p>The venue is accessible, but if you have any concerns about this then please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">get in touch</a> and we'll be more than happy to help you.</p>
    
    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>

    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>


    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
