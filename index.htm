    <h1>Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society</h1>

    <h2 class="frankenstein text--center">Victoria Frankenstein <span class="subhead">and the PhD of Doom</span></h2>
    <h3 class="text--center">3.30pm, Saturday 24th June &ndash; Clare College Memorial Court Lawns, Weeping Willow Side</h3>
    
    <p>In typical CULES fashion, we do not sell tickets for this show but we collect donations on entry (the suggested amount is Â£5 per person), which goes to charity.</p>

    
    <h3>Garden party</h3>
    
    <p>Victoria Frankenstein is followed by the CULES garden party! 
    <p>During the garden party we'll perform some short scripts from other writers, on the spot, using volunteer casts (we did this last year and it was great).</p>


    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/N2vvzX3cMVH2">Here's a map to Memorial Court</a>.</p>
    <p>If you enter from Queens Road, the Lawns are in front of the Court and you'll find us on the side with the weeping willow.</p>
    <p>If you have any concerns about accessibility then please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">get in touch</a> and we'll be more than happy to help you.</p>
    

    <h2>About CULES</h2>

    <div class="pullout">
        <p>Are our dramatics amateur beyond belief? Yes. Was the last Varsity match called a draw due to a lack of line learning? Yes.</p>

    <p>We're a student-run group who bring theatre (normally daft theatre) to those who don't normally get the chance to see it, like special needs schools and retirement homes. We also do public shows to raise money for various charities.</p>
    <p>We generally perform a play and a pantomime in both Michaelmas and Lent. In Easter we perform four short plays around a theme (designed to be manageable and relaxing for after exams!). All of these are written, directed and produced by members of the society, often first-timers.</p>
    <p>We also just like hanging out with each other. We go to the pub every Thursday. We go see shows put on by our sister society in Oxford, <a href="http://oules.lightentertainment.org/">OULES</a>, and they come to see us. We usually have a camping trip to somewhere with forests or mountains in the summer, and a three-day-long New Year's party together. Some of us head up to the Edinburgh Fringe in August to do a more professional show (also normally daft), with things like actual theatres, budgets, sometimes even rehearsals.</p>

    
    <h2 id="join">How to get involved</h2>
    <p>Just come along to our friendly open auditions at the beginning of each term, details of which get posted here and on our <a href="/mailing-lists.htm">mailing lists</a>. Even if you've never done anything like this before, we'd still like to see you! We have many parts with varying levels of commitment available, so if you don't want to take on too much, or if you want to steal the show, just let us know.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to be next term's shows, or just ask us about stuff, <a href="mailto:soc-cules-committee@lists.cam.ac.uk">drop us an email</a>.</p>
