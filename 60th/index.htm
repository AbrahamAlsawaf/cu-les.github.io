    <h1 class="cules">CULES 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Celebration</h1>
    <h2>Tickets are no longer available, sorry</h2>


    <p>Why, hello there. Are you a proud light entertainer who is ready to grace the CULES 60th anniversary celebration with your awesome presence?</p>

    <p>Well, we want you.</p>
        
    <p>The Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society (CULES) is a non-profit society which aims to bring theatre to those who may not have as much access to it such as the elderly and children with severe disabilities. Some of our most well-known members who have gone on to achieve fame include John Cleese and Sandi Toksvig.</p>
        
    <p>But in between running theatre productions and getting popular, we are also some of, if not the, funnest people to be around. So we are super excited to invite you to join fellow light entertainers to our 60th anniversary celebration to honour 60 years of silliness and laughter.</p>
